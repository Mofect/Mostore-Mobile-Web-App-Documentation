1. **Mobile APP URL**:  The default URL is https://yourdomain.com/mobile and can't be changed, because the App folder is automatically deployed in the WP root folder. If you want to use custom URL such as subdomain or change the app folder name, please enable the first option "Use Custom URL", Click the save button, then you will be able to change the Mobile APP URL.
2. **APP Name and Favicon:** App name will display as the page title of the web App as same as the favicon.
