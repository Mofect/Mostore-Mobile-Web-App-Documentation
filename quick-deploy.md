Then, please upload the whole '**Quick Deploy**' folder to your server, and rename the folder. The details of steps as below:

#### Deploy in subfolder:

If you want to deploy the mobile App under the subfolder and access it via https://domain.com/mobile. Just rename the folder to "mobile", then upload it to your WordPress installation root folder.

#### Deploy as subdomain:

You can also deploy the App as a separate sub-site and access it via https://m.domain.com.  Upload the 'build' folder to anywhere on your server, let's suppose to upload it to /home/domain/mobile folder.

Then, use this path as the root directory to create a new sub-site with your hosting panel or SSH \(if you use unmanaged VPS\).

Before you click the big button to connect App to your WooCommerce, you should know the following tips:

* 1. For security reason, your website must enable SSL, otherwise, the authentication process will be failed. You can simply use the free SSL certificate from [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
* 2. You must log in the administrator account.
* 3. You can cancel the authentication at any time by clicking the "Disconnect" button. Then, your WooCommerce consumer key and secret will be automatically deleted. Of course, you can still one click to rebuild the new connection.
* 4. Once you deactivate or uninstall Mofect Mobile Assistant plugin, your WooCommmerce consumer key and secret will be automatically deleted, it means you have to reconnect the mobile web app to your WooCommerce store if you reactivate this plugin.
* **4. We strongly suggest you rebuild the connection regularly.**
